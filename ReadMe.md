# 💫 About Me:
Hey, I’m Aastha, a third-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I’m passionate about backend development and have hands-on experience with Python (Django), Node.js, PHP, AWS, Firebase, and SQL databases. I’ve worked on full-stack projects, built and deployed applications on AWS, and developed REST APIs. I love taking on new challenges, participating in hackathons, and have even won competitions at IIT Delhi and DTU.
